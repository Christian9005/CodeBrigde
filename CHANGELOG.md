## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Simulator**: a virtual board that speaks the firmware protocol (`SimulatedTransport`, `.Simulator()` in the builder, *Simulator* in the editor's Port list and `--port simulator` in the host). Analog inputs follow a wave, digital inputs, sensors and distances can be scripted, outputs and PWM can be inspected.
- **`CodeBridge.Hosting`**: `AddCodeBridge()` registers a shared `BoardService` (serialized commands, automatic connection, background reconnection with backoff, simulator fallback, `Changed` event).
- **`CodeBridge.Blazor`**: `BoardStatus`, `PinToggle`, `PwmSlider`, `AnalogGauge`, `SensorChart` components (bUnit-tested) and the `Integration.Blazor` dashboard sample.
- **`CodeBridge.HomeAssistant`**: MQTT discovery bridge (switch, light, sensor, binary sensor), availability and last will, command handling, re-announcement when Home Assistant restarts, mDNS finder for Home Assistant; tested against a real embedded MQTT broker. Sample `Integration.HomeAssistant`.
- **MAUI sample** (`Integration.Maui`, Android and Windows).
- **More boards**: ESP32-S3 DevKit, ESP32-C3 DevKit, Arduino Nano (both bootloaders) and Arduino Mega 2560, with pin maps, ADC ranges, per-chip firmware images (`firmware/prebuilt/<chip>`), esptool chip/offset and Arduino FQBN taken from the board profile. The firmware builds for all of them in CI.

### Fixed
- Pairing a Wi-Fi network no longer overwrites the saved one unless the new network was joined successfully (found on real hardware: a failed attempt used to erase the working network).
- Deep-sleep wake-up by pin validated the pin and now builds on chips without ext1 wake-up (ESP32-C3).
- GPIO limits follow the chip (ESP32-S3 has pins up to 48) instead of a fixed 0-39.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-04

Security and stability hardening, Wi-Fi pairing from the editor, and the first math/PWM blocks.

### Security (firmware 0.9.0)
- **The Wi-Fi/TCP port is closed by default.** Clients must authenticate with a pairing token (`AUTH`) set over USB (`WTOK`); before, anyone on the network could drive the GPIO pins, change the Wi-Fi settings or start an OTA update.
- OTA only accepts `http(s)` URLs, checks every flash write, aborts on a stalled download and cannot be started without authentication.
- Constant-time token check, unauthenticated clients are dropped after 5 s, three failures drop the connection.

### Fixed
- Command lines longer than the buffer were executed truncated; they are now discarded with `ERR:Line too long` (USB and TCP).
- `R`, `RS`, `P`, `I`, `V`... matched `RST`, `PING`, `INFO`, `VER` by prefix (a stray `R` rebooted the board); commands now match exactly.
- I2C commands validate address and length (`IR`/`IRR` accepted any length, `IW`/`IWR` allocated whatever the line said).
- Wi-Fi passwords containing `:` were cut; `WCFG` takes the rest of the line and the new `WCFGX` accepts hex so any character works.
- `WifiTransport`: a late answer to a timed-out command could be taken as the answer to the next one (the connection now re-synchronizes with `PING` first); lines are length-limited; a dropped connection is reported instead of hanging; authentication errors are explained.
- One chatty TCP client can no longer starve the board's main loop.

### Added
- **Wi-Fi setup in the flow editor** (toolbar button): scan networks, enter the password, pair. Tokens are stored DPAPI-encrypted; the Port box accepts the board's IP afterwards.
- `Esp32WifiProvisioner` (`ScanAsync`, `GetStatusAsync`, `ProvisionAsync`, `ClearTokenAsync`), `.WiFi(ip, port, token)` and `WifiTransport(ip, port, token)`; `FlowHost wifi-scan|wifi-status|wifi-config|wifi-unpair`.
- **Map** block (convert a range, e.g. a 0-4095 reading into 0-255, with clamp/round) and **PWM Output** block (LED brightness, motor speed), both in the editor, the runtime and *Export C#*.
- Analog Read `samples` option (average several readings) to calm ADC noise.
- Tests: Wi-Fi transport against a fake 0.9 board (token, oversized lines, late answers), Map/PWM runtime-vs-export equivalence.

### Changed
- Firmware protocol 0.9: the SDK refuses older firmware (upload the new one from the editor). Wi-Fi clients without a token are rejected with a clear message.
- Samples `WiFiSetup` and `WiFiBlink` follow the pairing flow.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-09-30

First publishable release: the VSIX and the NuGet packages are now built from a single version.

### Added
- `build/pack.ps1` builds all NuGet packages (with symbols/SourceLink) and the VSIX; `release.yml` pushes to nuget.org and creates the GitHub release on `v*` tags.
- `CodeBridge.Designer.WinForms` now ships the ESP32 firmware (sources + prebuilt binaries) and copies it next to consuming apps.
- Automatic, pinned (esptool v5.4.0, SHA-256 verified) esptool download the first time firmware is flashed.
- Visual Studio theme integration (Light, Dark, Blue, High Contrast) for the `.cbflow` editor and the setup window.
- Release-consistency tests (versions, no developer paths, editor/runtime block parity) and Arduino firmware compatibility tests.
- CI builds both firmwares with PlatformIO; `SECURITY.md`, `docs/publishing.md`.

- **`.cbflow` editor rebuilt to behave like a Visual Studio tool**:
  - Toolbar with Board and Port pickers, *Connect* (connection test with firmware version), *Upload Firmware*, *Run / Stop* with optional *Loop*, Undo/Redo, zoom and an Output panel; status bar with connection state and problem counts.
  - Blocks run on the real board with live per-block badges (RUN / OK / SKIP / FAIL) and debug output.
  - Live validation through the runtime validator, with ERR/WARN badges and tooltips on the blocks.
  - Drag blocks from the Toolbox, double-click them, double-click the canvas (or Ctrl+Space) for a quick-add search, or use the context menu.
  - Multi-select (Ctrl/Shift click, selection rectangle), move together, snap to grid (Alt disables), arrow-key nudging, copy / cut / paste / duplicate, delete wires, undo/redo (100 steps) wired into the Edit menu.
  - Connections check types and loops, replace an occupied input, and snap to the nearest compatible port.
  - Pin options and blocks follow the selected board (ESP32 DevKit / Arduino Uno); the catalog is generated from the runtime catalog so it can no longer drift.
  - Zoom towards the cursor, pan with middle button or Space + drag, fit to view, infinite themed grid; right-click no longer resets the zoom.
  - Properties panel with readable labels and units, per-type validation, advanced section and a flow overview.
  - Every control (combo boxes, scroll bars, menus, check boxes) is themed with the active Visual Studio theme.
- The editor writes its messages to a **CodeBridge** pane of the Visual Studio Output window (the embedded panel is only a fallback outside Visual Studio).
- **Export C#**: the flow editor's *Export C#* button turns a flow into readable C# that uses the SDK: a static class with `RunAsync(IBoard board, CancellationToken ct)` that is added to the project next to the flow (or copied to the clipboard), or a complete console `Program.cs`. It follows the Loop checkbox, picks the project's namespace and names the class after the file. The generator is a public API (`CodeBridge.Flow.CodeGeneration.FlowCSharpGenerator`), so build tools can use it too. Tests compile the exported code with Roslyn and check that it sends exactly the same commands to the board as the flow runtime, for every shipped example. Blocks without an export yet (Sample Channel, Interrupt Input, Stream To Dashboard) become `// TODO` comments with a warning.
- **CodeBridge Tour** (Tools > CodeBridge Tour, offered once the first time a flow is opened): eight chapters that tell one story, from the first blink to using the SDK in a web API or a Windows service. Each chapter explains the idea, shows the animated blocks involved, lists the steps, has an **Open this example in my project** button and a **The same thing in C#** viewer (copy, or open in the editor). The C# shown is real, compiled sample code, so it cannot go stale.
- New SDK samples that compile in CI: `Integration.Console`, `Integration.Api` (ASP.NET minimal API: `POST /led/on`, `GET /sensor/34`, tested against a real ESP32) and `Integration.WindowsService` (Worker Service that logs a reading to CSV and reconnects by itself), plus `TourSnippets` (the five examples in C#).
- **Every block now explains itself**: hovering a block (Toolbox or canvas) shows a plain-language description, a looping vector animation of what it does (LED lighting, timer counting, servo sweeping, sensor wave...), the meaning of each input/output port and a tip. The Properties panel shows the same explanation. Animations are drawn with WPF shapes, so they follow the theme and add nothing to the VSIX.
- **Five example flows** in *Add > New Item* (Blink an LED, Blink pattern, Night light with a sensor, Servo sweep, Button controls LED), documented in `docs/examples.md`. Tests keep them valid.
- **Arrange** button lays the blocks out left to right by execution order with even spacing; blocks are more compact (narrower, tighter rows); the Toolbox keeps the basics up front and moves Pin Mode, Digital Output, Sample Channel, Interrupt Input and Stream To Dashboard to a collapsed *Advanced* group; backward wires bend less.
- `CodeBridge.FlowHost`, a small .NET 8 helper shipped inside the VSIX, gives the net472 extension access to ports, firmware upload (live esptool output), connection test, validation and flow execution.

### Fixed
- Editing a `.cbflow` after saving never marked it modified again (the dirty flag was never reset).
- **VSIX shipped without its NuGet packages**, so "Install CodeBridge WinForms Package" failed on any other machine. The Release build now fails if packages are missing.
- Hard-coded `C:\Projects\CodeBridge` paths removed from the installer and firmware lookup.
- Package installation restores CodeBridge packages from the bundled feed and their dependencies from nuget.org (previously only the local feed).
- Firmware flashing looked for `.pio/build/esp32dev` while PlatformIO builds `esp32`; it also skipped `boot_app0.bin`.
- Arduino Uno firmware reported version `0.1.0-uno`, which the SDK always rejected as a protocol mismatch.
- `.ToSTM32()`/`.ToArduino()` followed by `BuildAsync()` silently returned an ESP32 board; it now throws `NotSupportedException`.
- `SerialTransport` left the COM port open (locked) after a failed connect, leaked the port on disconnect, and could miss responses when several lines arrived in one read.
- Version drift between `Directory.Build.props`, the VSIX manifest and the toolbox manifest; Visual Studio range is now `[17.0, 19.0)`.

### Changed
- README only claims what is implemented (ESP32 supported, Arduino Uno basic, STM32/PIC planned).
- Stray test project `CodeBridge.ESP32.Tests` merged into `CodeBridge.Core.Tests`.
